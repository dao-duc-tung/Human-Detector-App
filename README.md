# Human Detector Desktop App
Histogram of Oriented Gradients-based Human Detector Desktop Application

This application shows how the HOG-based Human Detector works step by step.

I optimize this human detector by calling multiple threads when processing multi-scale images in Image Pyramid.

This human detector uses OpenCV trained SVM model.

* I will update the Non Maximum Suppression for removing overlap results later.

### License
The purpose of this project is for understanding how to extract HOG feature step by step.
Use at your own risk.
