Histogram of Oriented Gradients-based Human Detector Desktop Application

This application shows how the HOG-based Human Detector works step by step.

I optimize this human detector by calling multiple threads when processing multi-scale images in Image Pyramid.

This human detector uses OpenCV trained SVM model.
